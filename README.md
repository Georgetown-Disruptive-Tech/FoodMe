## About FoodMe

FoodMe is a simple and seamless way to simultaneously combat food waste and food insecurity by putting leftover food in the hands of those who need it most. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, over â…“ of all global food production is wasted every year, resulting in over $1 trillion USD worth of food waste.  At the same time, over 2.3 billion people worldwide are moderately to severely malnourished.  This disparity between widespread food waste and the world hunger crisis is a result of the lack of sufficient infrastructure capable of connecting leftover food resources from businesses and food providers to people who are struggling with food insecurity. **We aim to change this.**
